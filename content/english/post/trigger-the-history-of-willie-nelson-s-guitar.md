Willie Nelson is one of the most iconic country music singers of all time. But did you know that his trusted six-string is just as famous as he is? This post will uncover everything you never knew about Willie Nelson’s guitar, Trigger.

Since 1969, the Martin N-20 Classical named Trigger has been Willie Nelson’s guitar of choice. He has played the guitar on every album and during every live performance over the past fifty years. If you’ve ever listened to Willie Nelson’s songs, you’ve probably heard him play his beloved guitar. Trigger has joined in on over 10,000 live concerts and more than 85 studio albums to date.

## **How Did Willie Nelson Get Trigger?**

Believe it or not, the story of Trigger begins when Willie’s previous guitar, the 800C Electric Classical, was destroyed by a drunken fan in 1969. He was playing a show with his band in Helotes, TX, at the John T. Floore Country Store. Willie placed his guitar in its case at the foot of the stage, where it was stepped on and smashed.

Nelson was determined to save his old guitar, which was gifted to him by Baldwin, the piano company, just one year earlier in 1968. He sent it to his old pal, Shot Jackson, who was skilled in guitar repairs. Unfortunately, Jackson had to be the bearer of bad news when he discovered that the guitar was damaged beyond repair. To soften the blow, he offered Willie a Martin N-20 for $750. This is the guitar that would come to be known as Trigger.

It's been over 50 years since Willie Nelson first crossed paths with the Martin N-20 named Trigger, and they have been inseparable ever since.

When Willie first started playing Trigger, it was virtually unrecognizable to the old, beat-up guitar that it is today. It was a blank canvas, a sharp-looking, amber-colored guitar, without any of the holes or scars it is known for today.

## **What Makes Willie Nelson’s Guitar So Special?**

Just like most country music artists, Willie Nelson is known to be quite particular about his acoustic guitars.

Willie loved the Prismatone guitar pickup that was unique to his Baldwin guitar at the time. This new-age technology allowed artists to amplify their acoustic sound using a stereo cable, similar to an electric guitar. With that said, he was notably not a fan of its bulky neck.

Willie’s buddy, Shot Jackson, made him an offer that he couldn’t refuse by combining all of the elements he preferred in a guitar. He rigged up the Martin N-20 with the same Prismatone pickup specific to the Baldwin. That way, Nelson could plug it into the C10 amplifier that Baldwin had gifted him along with the guitar.

Trigger is intricately constructed from a Sitka spruce top, with the top and back made from Brazilian Rosewood. The neck of the guitar is made from mahogany, and ebony was used to craft the fretboard and bridge. The unique, warm, and mellow sound results from the carefully selected combination of tonewoods.

## **The Bond Between Willie Nelson and Trigger**

One of the most iconic anecdotes about Willie Nelson and his beloved guitar, Trigger, took place in 1969, not long after he had first acquired the guitar. A raging fire ignited, setting his Ridgetop, Tennessee, home up in flames. Sadly, the house burned to the ground, destroying everything inside, including some of Nelson’s latest work. However, before the fire consumed the home, Willie urgently headed back inside to recover two of his most precious possessions: his trusty guitar Trigger and a pound of “real good weed.”

Although it was undoubtedly difficult to watch his life’s work burn to the ground, there was a silver lining to this tragic event. At the time, Willie had some festering discontent about the current trajectory of his career. Of course, he was met with early success in terms of his songwriting and performances throughout Nashville. However, he was unhappy with the state of the country music industry itself. When his house burned up, it gave him the opportunity for a fresh start with his music career.

Shortly after the fire, Nelson returned to his home state of Texas, where he played in many of the top honky-tonk clubs. This is where he cultivated a new beginning for his music career. One that featured Trigger at the forefront.

## **Willie Nelson’s Guitar Takes Center Stage**

Trigger made its debut in Nelson’s 1973 album _Shotgun Willie_. This was his first album with Atlantic Records. The album contains plenty of cult-favorite classics such as "Shotgun Willie" and "Whiskey River.” Since then, Willie has played the instrument on every studio album he has released.

A year later, in 1974, Willie performed on a television series for the first time in the pilot episode of _Austin City Limits_. Of course, Trigger was right by his side every step of the way. To this day, the series is the longest-running music series on television.

## **Why is There a Hole in Willie Nelson’s Guitar?**

If you watch old videos of Nelson’s 1974 performances, you’ll find that he had already weathered a hole through old Trigger.

The hole can be found beneath the bridge of the guitar, a result of Nelson’s rough picking style. Willie often alternates between finger picking and strumming Trigger with a pick. So, the wear and tear resulted from a combination of the two. However, Trigger wasn’t designed to be played with a pick at all, so this causes additional wear and tear to the country legend’s precious guitar.

## **How Does Nelson Maintain His Guitar?**

Not long after Willie Nelson started playing Trigger, he realized that he would need to go above and beyond to keep his guitar in good condition. After all, Willie loves his guitar so much that he considers it a member of the band. If Trigger can’t go on stage, neither will Willie Nelson. Thankfully, Nelson has been in contact with his trusted luthier, Mark Erlewine, since the mid-1970s. Erlewine has added mahogany braces behind the soundboard to address the growing hole in old Trigger. However, the guitar still sustains plenty of regular damage, and the large hole is still apparent in the face of the guitar. Today, Trigger has biannual appointments with Erlewine to keep the guitar in working condition.

## **How Long Will Willie Nelson Play Trigger?**

There’s no indication that Nelson will be willing to switch guitars any time soon, or ever for that matter. In interviews, he has been quoted saying that both he and his guitar will probably give out at the same time. Nelson has only been separated from the guitar in 1990 when the IRS seized most of his possessions. During this time, Trigger was sent to Hawaii to “hide out.”
