Howard Dumble is a legendary figure in the world of guitar amplifiers. His amplifiers, known as "Dumble" amps, are highly sought after by guitarists due to their exceptional tone and versatility. However, the history of Dumble and his amplifiers is shrouded in mystery, and the controversy surrounding his business practices has earned him a reputation as a reclusive and enigmatic figure.

Howard Dumble was born in 1943 in Southern California. Not much is known about his early life or education, but it is believed that he developed an interest in music and electronics at an early age. Dumble began working as a repairman for a local music store in the 1960s, where he gained a reputation for his skills in fixing and modifying amplifiers.

In the 1970s, Dumble began building his own amplifiers under the name "Dumble Amplifiers." These amplifiers were highly regarded by musicians for their unique sound and flexibility. Dumble's amplifiers were known for their ability to produce a wide range of tones, from clean and pristine to heavily distorted and overdriven. They were also notable for their ability to switch between different "channels," allowing the guitarist to easily switch between different tonal settings.

Despite the popularity of his amplifiers, Dumble remained a relatively unknown figure in the music industry. He was notoriously reclusive and rarely gave interviews or made public appearances. This, combined with the fact that he only built a small number of amplifiers each year, made Dumble amplifiers highly coveted and difficult to obtain.

In the 1980s, Dumble's amplifiers gained a cult following among musicians, with many high-profile guitarists such as Eric Johnson, Larry Carlton, and Robben Ford using them on stage and in the studio. The demand for Dumble amplifiers continued to grow, but Dumble remained tight-lipped about his business and did not mass-produce his amplifiers or license his designs to other manufacturers.

This secrecy and exclusivity only added to the mystique of Dumble and his amplifiers, and it is believed that he turned down many offers to sell his company or license his designs. Dumble's refusal to compromise on quality or quantity has made his amplifiers highly sought after by collectors and musicians, with some models selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars on the used market.

Despite the high demand for Dumble amplifiers, there has been controversy surrounding Dumble's business practices. Some musicians have criticized Dumble for being difficult to work with and for his high prices. There have also been allegations that Dumble was unresponsive to repair requests and that he charged exorbitant fees for service.

In recent years, Dumble has largely retired from the amplifier business and has not produced new amplifiers since the 1990s. However, his legacy as a pioneering amplifier designer and builder lives on, with many musicians and collectors still searching for the elusive "Dumble sound."

Overall, the history of Howard Dumble and his amplifiers is one of mystery, exclusivity, and controversy. While his amplifiers are highly sought after for their exceptional tone and versatility, his reclusive personality and business practices have earned him a reputation as a enigmatic figure in the music industry.
